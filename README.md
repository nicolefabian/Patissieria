# Order iOS Mobile Application Prototype for ABC Bakery

<p align="justify">
ABC Bakery, based on a real bakery shop located at Ormiston Mall, Auckland, New Zealand, specialises in selling Asian pastries. At the current stage, the store only provides a website that customers can visit to get basic information about their store and its owner. However, the website is lacking in essential information as it does not show the menu up front and only has a QR code as the primary means to order online. This QR code directs customers to a page stating that orders are only supported using WeChat.
